# ðŸ”§ GitHub Actions Build Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. **Build Warning: "Failed to download MeshCore during build"**

- **Cause**: GitHub Actions builders may not have access to external sites during build
- **Fix**: Enhanced fallback content creation with proper HTML structure
- **Result**: Container will build successfully even without internet access during build

### 2. **Container Startup Failure**

- **Cause**: Entrypoint script was checking wrong directory structure for new symlink-based system
- **Fix**: Updated entrypoint to:
  - Check for `/app/web/current` symlink instead of `/app/web` directory
  - Auto-create symlink to build-time version if missing
  - Add comprehensive debugging output
  - More robust error handling

### 3. **Connection Timeout in Tests**

- **Cause**: Container taking longer to start, health endpoint not ready quickly enough
- **Fix**: Enhanced GitHub Actions test with:
  - Extended timeout (180s instead of 120s)
  - Initial startup delay (10s) before health checks
  - Better logging and debugging
  - Container status checking
  - More robust HTML content detection

### 4. **Script Sourcing Issues**

- **Cause**: Circular dependencies and conflicting log functions between scripts
- **Fix**: Removed sourcing, copied necessary functions directly into update script

## Key Changes Made

### `/entrypoint.sh` - Enhanced startup process:

```bash
# Added debugging output
log "Initial directory structure:"
ls -la /app/versions/ /app/web/

# Auto-recovery for missing symlinks
if [ ! -L "/app/web/current" ]; then
    if [ -d "/app/versions/build-time" ]; then
        log "Creating symlink to build-time version..."
        ln -sf /app/versions/build-time /app/web/current
    fi
fi
```

### `/.github/workflows/docker.yml` - More robust testing:

```yaml
# Extended timeout and better debugging
timeout 180 bash -c 'until curl -f http://localhost:8080/health; do echo "Waiting..."; sleep 5; done'

# Better HTML content detection
if echo "$response" | grep -qi "html\|<title\|<head\|<body"; then
    echo "âœ… HTML content found"
```

### `/Dockerfile` - Better fallback content:

```dockerfile
# Enhanced fallback HTML with proper structure
echo '<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>MeshCore (Offline)</title>...'
```

### `/scripts/update-meshcore.sh` - Self-contained:

- Removed script sourcing dependencies
- Added all necessary functions directly
- Better error handling and logging

## Expected Results

1. **Build will succeed** even if external site is unreachable during GitHub Actions build
2. **Container will start reliably** with fallback content if needed
3. **Tests will pass** with proper HTML content detection
4. **Runtime updates will work** when the container has internet access

## Testing Locally

Once Docker Desktop is running, test with:

```bash
# Clean build test
./test.sh clean
./test.sh build

# Full test including startup
./test.sh test
```

The container should now start successfully even in environments with limited internet access during build time, such as GitHub Actions runners.
